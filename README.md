# Overview of the App
This React app is designed to manage and display a list of bikes. It includes features such as fetching bike data from a JSON file, displaying the data in a table, and allowing users to search and filter the bikes based on various criteria. The app is built using TypeScript to ensure type safety and improve code quality. This uses Typescript and React.

## Key Features
Data Fetching: The app fetches bike data from a JSON file located in the public directory and displays it in a table.
Data Display: The table component displays various attributes of each bike, such as ID, Make, Model, Year, Displacement, Price, Terrain, and Description.
Search and Filter: Users can search and filter the bike data based on different criteria such as ID, Make, Model, Year, etc.
Responsive UI: The app is designed to be responsive and user-friendly, ensuring a good user experience on different devices.
How to Get Started
Prerequisites
Ensure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine. You can download them from Node.js official website.

## Installation
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git

### Navigate to the project directory:
cd your-repo

### Install dependencies:
npm install

### Running the App
Start the development server:

npm start
This command runs the app in development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to view it. The page will reload if you make any edits, and you will see lint errors in the console.
Running Tests
Launch the test runner:

npm test
This command launches the test runner in interactive watch mode. For more information on running tests, refer to the running tests section of the Create React App documentation.
Building for Production
Build the app:

npm run build
This command builds the app for production, creating an optimized build in the build folder. The build is minified, and the filenames include the hashes. Your app is ready to be deployed! For more details on deployment, refer to the deployment section of the Create React App documentation.
Customizing the Configuration
If you need to customize the configuration (e.g., webpack, Babel, ESLint), you can eject the app. Note that this is a one-way operation, and once you eject, you cannot go back.

Eject the app:

npm run eject
This command will remove the single build dependency from your project, copying all the configuration files and transitive dependencies directly into your project. After ejecting, you will have full control over the configuration.
